This is the assignment given by GetGoLogistics Private Limited. Task was to Create a Pie or Bar Chart for following details
<ul>
  <li> Donâ€™t use any chart library</li>
 <li>Display 4 users with different colors</li>
  <li> Let say A has Rs 30, B has Rs 25, C has Rs 15 and D has Rs 30</li>
  </ul>
So i created both Bar Chart and Pie chart by using only Javascript(not any chart library).
I used some styling property to give better look.
